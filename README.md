# Event Store In One Hour
Repository for Live Stream "Event Store in One Hour"

## Where is the empty state?

Master branch shows already finished Event Store. 

To start with the fresh state checkout the [starting_point](https://github.com/oskardudycz/EventStoreInOneHour/tree/starting_point) branch. When code is created then you need to sequentially uncomment tests.

## How to built the Event Store on your own?

Go to the main repository [Event Sourcing .NET Workshop](https://github.com/oskardudycz/EventSourcing.NetCore/tree/master/Workshop)   and do the exercies one by one. They're structured to guide that and it's easier to follow the process.

## Should I build my own Event Store?

You can, but I recommend using some ready battle-tested ready and maintained like [Marten](martendb.io/)
